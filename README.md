## Featured Cities (v3.3)

The toolkit now supports **5 cities** out-of-the-box, accessible via the hosted viewer at:

**https://osyanne.github.io/cs2-minneapolis-osm-toolkit/**

| City | Country | Modules |
|------|---------|---------|
| Minneapolis, MN | USA | Zoning + Vial + Services (hero, fully featured) |
| Manhattan, NYC | USA | Zoning |
| Tokyo (Central) | Japan | Zoning |
| Amsterdam | Netherlands | Zoning |
| Madison, WI | USA | Zoning |

Vial + services for the 4 newer cities are **on-demand**: open a [City Request issue](https://github.com/Osyanne/cs2-minneapolis-osm-toolkit/issues/new?template=city-request.yml) requesting them, and we'll generate.

### Adding your city

Open a [City Request issue](https://github.com/Osyanne/cs2-minneapolis-osm-toolkit/issues/new?template=city-request.yml) with the bbox + name. We'll generate the zoning prebuilt and publish (~30-60 min turnaround when active).

### Repo rename — pending

This repo will eventually be renamed `cs2-osm-toolkit` to reflect multi-city support. Rename is deferred until current Reddit traffic decays. Existing links and clones continue to work via GitHub redirects.

## Quick Start — Pick Your Path

### Path A: Just look at Minneapolis (5 minutes, no Python)

Download the prebuilt data files from the [latest release](https://github.com/Osyanne/cs2-minneapolis-osm-toolkit/releases):

1. Download `datos_zonificacion.js`, `datos_vial.js`, and `datos_servicios.js`
2. Download or clone this repo to get the `visualizer/` folder
3. Place all three `.js` files in the `visualizer/` folder
4. Double-click `visualizer/index.html`

Done. No terminal, no Python, no setup.

### Path B: Use it for your city (15–20 minutes, requires Python)

Full step-by-step walkthrough (install Python, install uv, find your city's bbox, run the extractors): [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

The short version:
1. Install Python 3.11+ with "Add to PATH" checked, then install uv
2. Open a terminal in the `src/` folder and run `uv sync`
3. Run the three extractors with your city's bounding box:

        uv run extract-zoning --bbox "south,west,north,east"
        uv run extract-vial --bbox "south,west,north,east"
        uv run extract-services --bbox "south,west,north,east"

See also: [docs/adapting-to-other-cities.md](docs/adapting-to-other-cities.md) for city-specific calibration guidance and example bboxes.

**Common issues?** See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Path C: Develop or contribute

Clone the repo, run `uv sync` inside `src/`, run tests with `uv run pytest`. All technical details below.

## What This Does

A modular toolkit that extracts real-world infrastructure data from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API and renders it on an interactive dark-mode Leaflet map. Built as a reference layer for players recreating Minneapolis 1:1 in Cities: Skylines 2. Three modules, ~192k total features.

### 🗺 Zoning Module
Classifies all building polygons into the **11 official Cities: Skylines 2 zone types** (Low/Medium/High Density Residential, Row Housing, Mixed Housing, Low Rent Housing, Low/High Density Business, Low/High Density Offices, Industrial Manufacturing). 81,732 polygons in the Minneapolis bbox.

Run: `cd src && uv run extract-zoning`
Output: `visualizer/datos_zonificacion.js` (~28 MB)

### 🛣 Road Network Module
Classifies all OSM roads into the **6 CS2 road categories** (Highway, Major Road, Minor Road, Local Street, Pedestrian Path, Bike Lane). Renders as LineString overlay. 108,825 features.

Run: `cd src && uv run extract-vial`
Output: `visualizer/datos_vial.js` (~25 MB)

### 🏥 Services Module
5 layers aligned to the base service tabs of Cities: Skylines 2 with good OpenStreetMap coverage:

- **H** Healthcare & Deathcare — hospitals, clinics, doctors, funeral directors, crematoriums, cemeteries
- **E** Education & Research — schools, universities, colleges, kindergartens, research institutes
- **B** Fire — fire stations
- **A** Police & Administration — police HQ, city hall, courthouses, prison + cultural landmarks (libraries, museums, theatres, arts centres, cinemas) + government offices
- **P** Parks — parks, nature reserves, gardens, playgrounds, sports centres

Run: `cd src && uv run extract-services`
Output: `visualizer/datos_servicios.js` (~1.3 MB)

**Notes:**
- Libraries, museums, theatres, arts centres, cinemas share the `admin` bucket with police and government offices. They differ only by name + subtype in the popup.
- Places of worship intentionally excluded (not in CS2 base game structure).
- Electricity, water & sewage, waste management deferred to Session 4 (require EIA + MN GIS Commons + opendata.minneapolismn.gov sources, not OSM).
- Minneapolis bbox typically returns ~2,300 features. Async chunked rendering prevents browser blocking during init.

### Coming next
- 🚌 Transit Module (Blue/Green Line, BRT, bus routes, bikeways) — Session 4

## Visualizer Features

- **Module pills (top right)**: toggle entire modules on/off in one click
- **Master toggles in legend**: same effect, mirrored in the sidebar
- **Background mode** (when modules are off): Hidden / Faded / Full
- **Layer Control** (top right): granular per-zone / per-road-category toggles
- **Canvas renderer**: smooth pan/zoom with 80k+ polygons + 108k linestrings
- **Tier-based hiding**: individual houses hide at zoom <14, blocks stay visible
- **CS2-faithful color palette**: 4 families (green/blue/purple/yellow) aligned to the game HUD
- **Dark theme**: CartoDB Dark Matter basemap
- **Persistence**: view state saved to localStorage (`cs2-mineapolis-view-state-v1`)

## Technical Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (faster pip+venv replacement)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osyanne/cs2-minneapolis-osm-toolkit.git
cd cs2-minneapolis-osm-toolkit/src
uv sync
```

### Get prebuilts

The prebuilt `datos_*.js` files (~53 MB total) are **not** in this repo. Two ways to get them:

**Option A — Download from GitHub Releases** (recommended):
1. Go to https://github.com/Osyanne/cs2-minneapolis-osm-toolkit/releases
2. Download `datos_zonificacion.js`, `datos_vial.js`, and `datos_servicios.js` from the latest release
3. Place them in `visualizer/`

**Option B — Regenerate locally**:
```bash
cd src
uv run extract-zoning    # ~3-5 min
uv run extract-vial      # ~30s
uv run extract-services  # ~30s
```

### Serve the visualizer

```bash
cd visualizer
python -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080/index.html
```

### Run tests

```bash
cd src
uv run pytest
```

127 tests passing across zoning, vial, and services modules.

## Adapting to Other Cities

The bbox is parametric — point the extractors at a different `--bbox` and you get the same map for any city with OSM coverage.

See [docs/adapting-to-other-cities.md](docs/adapting-to-other-cities.md) for city-specific guidance, example bboxes, and density threshold calibration.
